The use of a SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platform is to help organizations streamline and enhance their cybersecurity operations. SOAR platforms combine security orchestration and automation capabilities with incident response management to enable efficient handling of security incidents. So here we are using the chatGPT to make the SOAR platform more effectivly.

Things to be built:

[ ] Incident Management <br/>
[ ] Orchestration and Automation <br/>
[ ] Threat Intelligence Integration <br/>
[ ] Playbook Creation <br/>
[ ] Collaboration and Communication <br/>
[ ] Reporting and Metrics <br/>
[ ] Remove the sensitive information like API Keys, passwords before ChatGPT analyse the code <br/>

Incident Management:
First step of the SOAR Platform is the Incident Management where there should be the IDS/IPS.
